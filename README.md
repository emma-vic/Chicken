<h1> <strong> Hypothesis </strong> </h1>
<body> <em>GogoSqueez</em> can improve an individual's overall strength and relieve stress (physically and mentally)! </body>
<h1> <strong> Background Info </strong></h1>
<p> I have been recently re-introduced to a delicious snack, <em>GoGoSqueeZ</em>, thanks to my dear cross country coach, Mr. Marchant! The first squirt that went into my mouth a week ago was delicious, not being overally sweet yet still leaving a satisfied taste in my mouth. Right then, I knew that these <em> GoGoSqueeZ</em> packets definitely had to benefit me in some way. </p>
<p> Once assigned this webpage, I thought long and hard what should I make mine about. I wanted it to be something that I can look back on and laugh about, but also carry some meaning to me. After thinking about it, the perfect idea came to me once I finished my daily <em> GoGoSqueeZ</em> packet. Why don't I do a reflection on this new routine of mine for this webpage? </p>
