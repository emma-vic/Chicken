# Emma's Personal <em> GoGo SqueeZ </em> Experiment - GoGo SqueeZ is necessary.
<p> <em>*I am no nutritionist in any way, and a scientific conclusion can not be made. The evidence I provided was, in fact, true, and I will leave you on the main point -- eat some GoGo SqueeZ.</em> </p>

<h1> Hypothesis</h1>
<body> <em>GoGo Squeez</em> can improve an individual's overall being and relieve stress (physically and mentally)! </body>
<h1> <strong> Background Info </strong></h1>
<p> I have been recently re-introduced to a delicious snack, <em>GoGo SqueeZ</em>, thanks to my cross country coach, Mr. Marchant! The first squirt that went into my mouth a week ago was delicious, not being overally sweet yet still leaving a satisfied taste in my mouth. Right then, I knew that these <em> GoGo SqueeZ</em> packets definitely had to benefit me in some way. </p>
<p> Once assigned this webpage, I thought long and hard what should I make mine about. I wanted it to be something that I can look back on and also carry some meaning to me. After thinking about it, the perfect idea came to me once I finished my daily <em> GoGo SqueeZ</em> packet. Why don't I do a reflection on this new routine of mine for this webpage? </p>
<h1> <strong> Experiment </strong></h1>
<body> The process is simple (maybe too simple)- I eat GoGo Squeez and see how I feel!</body>

<h2> Debrief of each day last week</h2>
<p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Monday, September 18th - 1 Packet (Consumed at 9:34am, Flavor: <em> AppleApple</em>).</strong> Felt good overall with some difficulty in math.</li>
  <li><strong>Tuesday, September 19th - 2 Packets (Consumed at 9:36am and during lunch, Flavors: <em> AppleApple</em>).</strong>Slept well last night with 7 hours, but felt tired overall. Happy levels were high and I felt overall refreshed except before I went to sleep (felt overwhelmed)</li>
  <li> <strong>Wednesday, September 20th - 4 Packets (Consumed one in CompSci class, one after math class, two at the cross country race; Flavors: <em> AppleApple, AppleCinnamon)</em></strong> Slept awful last night because of a project, and had a stomachache but went away after I smoothly unloaded. I finished most of my homework before 8pm! I didn't perform as well as I'd hope for the cross country race, but the pain wasn't death defying which is really good. I still felt proud of myself and had a fun day. Katelyn bought me a snowcone, too.</li>
  <li> <strong>Thursday, September 21st - 3 Packets (Consumed one at 9:38am, consumed one during snack, consumed one afterschool; Flavors: <em> AppleApple</em>).</strong> Slept well last night. Felt happy most of the day. Two general meetings during lunch, but I was able to go to both. I did good during the socratic seminar in english class. Mom made sinigang for dinner, super delicious. A verified person requested to follow me on instagram..</li>
  <li> <strong>Friday, September 22nd - 1 Packet (Consumed during lunch, Flavor: <em> AppleApple</em>).</strong> Slept amazing last night with 7+ hours. I had an appointment and had to skip the first half of school. XC was fun and we got cake. I ate a bagel sandwich (egg, avocado, tomato, bacon) for breakfast and for lunch I ate a chocolate chip bagel and a <em>GoGo SqueeZ</em>. I finished a whole chapter of annotations for <em> Lord of the Flies</em>for english class. I had my last driving class and I got my certificate.</li>
  <li> <strong>Saturday, September 23rd - 0 Packets</strong>. Fun day at a birthday party, but I left my retainer at a restaurant during breakfast with my dad and got introuble with my mom. I am now grounded and can not get boba or go buy things for a long time as my retainer replacement is expensive.</li>
  <li> Total: 11 Packets in 5 days</li>
</ul></p>
<p> <strong> Wednesday, September 27th - 0 Packets.</strong> The terrible things that happened..
  <ol>
    <li> Left 0 Period 30 minutes in because I wasn't feeling good</li>
    <li> Had to cancel a meeting last minute </li>
    <li> Got into a car accident and bonked my head hard on the door</li>
    <li> Police came into our neighborhood because a suspicious stranger was lingering in our neighbor's driveway</li>
    <li> 0/10 on my english assignment because I didn't inquire what the activity post was about when I was at a XC race; not sure if I could still get credit</li>
    <li> A really runny nose and headache throughout the day</li>
    <li> Can not taste food well because my nose is clogged</li>
    <li> massive load of homework/classwork to make up</li>
    </ol></p>

<h2> A Conclusion</h2>
<p> In conclusion, while I did not limit the outliers and factors, one thing that was clear is that the few days after Wednesday, when I consumed four packets, were amazing and the days that followed when I consumed 3 packets and 1 packet, there were more good things that happened. On Saturday, when I didn't eat ANY <em> Gogo SqueeZ</em>, it took a downfall as I became grounded from forgetting my retainer at a restaurant. I continued eating one pack of<em> GoGo Squeez</em> Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, and all my days were good/okay. However, on Wednesday, I did not fuel with <em>GoGo SqueeZ,</em> and the day was clearly very difficult and I met a low point in my life.</p>
<p> This evidence supports that when I consume more packets of <em>GoGo SqueeZ</em> I attract the universe to grant me amazing luck. My life progressively became more and more marvelous and was good when I continue my <em>GoGo SqueeZ</em> streak, yet ends on a sad note the days I don't eat any. Personally, I strongly believe <em>GoGo SqueeZ</em> impacting my day is causation, not correlation. </p>
<h2> You.</h2>
<p> If you made it this far, I hope this influences you to consider eating <em>GoGo SqueeZ</em>. While some still may not believe that they made amazing fortune happen in my life and helped me avoid the bad, they are delicious snacks that will definitely bring a smile to your face and will bring you some happiness. They truly made me happier every pouch I consumed. <em> GoGo SqueeZ forever!</em></p>
